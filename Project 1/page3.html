<h1><p style="color:springgreen;">Who Is Tiny, Really?</h1>
<p><p style="color:seagreen;">
<br>Tiny's hobbies include bossing her herdmates around, searching coat pockets for treats, and avoiding the tree by the arena at <em>all costs</em>. Why you ask? Because one of these days it's going to leap from the ground and eat her. One of these days. 
<br>Scaredy-cat though she may be, Tiny really does like to explore. She enjoys going on walks with me in unfamiliar places, just so long as we don't stay out too long. And while she doesn't necessarily enjoy the kind of roughhousing some of her young pasturemates do, she certainly enjoys running, turning, and leaping like some kind of sprite -- it has given her a bit of a "crazy" or "hot" reputation, but she just has so much to express! When she is calm and relaxed, she enjoys a good scratch on her croup or her belly, and sometimes likes to stand and rest her head in the crook of my arm. Possibly one of her favorite things in the whole world is enjoying a thorough grooming and massage while she grazes in one of her favorite spots. Tiny is rather clean, for a horse, and getting dirty and muddy actually seems to bother her more than most -- at least, I've seen her avoid mud and puddles where others will tredge right through. The only part of grooming she doesn't like so much is having her hooves oiled and polished! But clean as she may be, that doesn't mean she doesn't enjoy a good dust bath. So, after hours of hard work polishing her to a radiant gleam, she very much enjoys a good roll in the dirt, while I watch. 
<br>Tiny is also the kind of horse who enjoys a good challenge -- take that as you will. But, she really enjoys having a puzzle to figure out or a job to do. She's very smart, and sometimes entertaining the boys all day gets a little dull. She's a good partner and enjoys learning new things -- especially when she gets payed (read: treats. Copious treats). 
<br> Tiny really does soak up attention -- but she also has a lot of love to give. She's such a sensitive horse and travels through life primarily emotionally. That's something I can relate to, and absolutely love her for.
