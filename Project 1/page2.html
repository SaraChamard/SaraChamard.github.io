<h1><p style="color:plum;">About Tiny</h1>

<p><p style="color:orchid;">
<strong>Tiny is a gorgeous mahogany bay Appendix Quarter Horse -- that is, a Quarter Horse and Thoroughbred cross. </strong>
<br>In exactly what percentage, I cannot say for sure. I do know what it means, though: she is small and <em>quick</em>, and also has a great butt. Other than that, she has a very refined, sometimes nearly Arabian-esque look. 
<br> Furthermore, she likes to make <em>verytightturns</em> and show off all her agility.  
<br><strong>Tiny is... tiny.</strong>
<br>I didn't name her, but it suits her (plus, it's usually bad luck to change a horse's name! Luckily for us both, her name is pretty cute). Tiny stands 14.3 hands tall, so, about 4.8' at the withers. Technically she's about an inch away from being pony-height, which is perfect, because I too, am very small. 
<br>Tiny has another name, too. She was registered with, and shown under, the name "My Magnolia Breeze", which is beautiful. Just like her. 
<br><strong>Speaking of... Tiny had a show career!</strong>
<br> It wasn't with me, but when Tiny was young, she was shown in Western Pleasure, I believe, with the American Quarter Horse Association. She did very well, she'll have you know! But I am not very competitive myself, and she and I are pretty content to do our own thing these days.
