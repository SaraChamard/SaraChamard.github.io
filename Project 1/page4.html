<h1><p style="color:wheat;">Tiny's Family</h1>
 <p><p style="color:midnightblue;"> 
Tiny is an important member of the Chamard family. However, it is only my mom and myself who work with her and spend the most time with her. 
<br> I got Tiny as a surprise when I was 10 years old, and she was 8. She is literally a dream come true, and absolutely my heart horse.
